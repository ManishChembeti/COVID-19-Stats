As analysing, evaluating and monitoring the risks are the most important steps in the Risk 
Management Plan, We are going to build a web application that helps follow this particular 
plan accordingly. Our web-app will provide live information on the number of cases all over 
the world and also in particular countries as well. We will be providing information on 
different categories on our app such as the number of actively confirmed cases, recovered 
cases, deaths caused and much more. By monitoring the live status and keeping track of the 
overview, businesses could be planned and well prepared about their functioning 
correspondingly.

As we drive through the current situation, dealing with the COVID-19 emergency, employee 
safety in the workplace is a top priority for all organizations. Smart working surely represents 
the best containment measure, but is not always applicable: many people working in strategic 
sectors still need to go to their workplace - and the highest safety level must be ensured in 
this case.

Knowing if and when someone has been potentially exposed to COVID-19 is key for them -
unfortunately, it's not an easy information to obtain due to the virus' long incubation period 
and extreme contagiousness even through asymptomatic subjects.

To support companies during this complex phase, Techedge has developed COVID-19 
Tracker: a solution that allows organizations to monitor their workforce probability of being 
exposed to the virus and the risk of being infected - enabling to take timely decisions to limit 
the spread, promptly informing the exposed employees and performing targeted sanitization 
activities on the involved locations.
